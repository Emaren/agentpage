The open plan with a multitude of large windows and expansive deck begs you to stop, relax, and soak in the beautiful view of LGCC's 15th green. A few steps will take you to the 16th tee to fit in a couple holes before dusk... with the course to yourself. The beauty of a home backing on to the course is often overlooked by non-golfers. The scenery is spectacular. Folks love to walk the course in the early Spring/late Fall or x-country ski in the Winter. This home is also ideally located near many of the Lacombe's best schools. The quiet 58A Street Crescent draws local traffic only; yet it is a short and easy drive to Hwy 12 and the QEII access. The yard is beautifully landscaped, a manageable size, peaceful, and private. Your family and friends will cherish their time in the comfortably spacious 2 storey with too many special features to mention.
